    <h1>Values</h1>
    <p>Values
      Extending the Love of Jesus 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 says Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

      Accountability Being willing to answer for the outcomes resulting from your choices, behaviors, and actions.

      Independence Having the resources to be able to survive without outside assistance and free from outside control.</p>

    <h1>Why</h1>
<p >Women & children are the new faces of family homelessness, projected to make up the vast majority of family homelessness in the future

      Most homeless mothers have experienced severe physical & sexual abuse in BOTH childhood & adult relationships

      This results is post-traumatic stress (psychic numbing, rage reactions, re-living past trauma, depression, anxiety, endless watchfulness, sleeplessness), interfering with the ability to meet their familyâ€™s needs

      The children of homeless mothers have experienced violence, chronic loss and instability causing them to exhibit physical and emotional challenges
